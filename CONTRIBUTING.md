How can I contribute?
---------------------

This project started as a way for me to learn about RPM packaging. To some extent, it is meant to remain simple enough that it can help someone else learn about publishing RPM packages themselves.

If you are currently learning about RPM packaging, let's learn together! I probably misunderstood things, made mistakes and missed the mark on some trade-offs. If something seems odd, mistaken, or you simply cannot quite make sense of why I would have done it that way, please open a discussion! Chances are either I had a reason to do that and we can discuss it, or you found something I didn't! Either way, we'll likely learn something üéâ

- Open a [discussion][discussions] to explain what you observe, and what you expect or don't understand
- I'll comment there as soon as I can
- We can find out together the next steps to improve on the code, or the documentation, or both! and open an [issue][issue] to describe that
- Once we have a clear idea of _what_ we want to achieve, you can open a [pull request][pr] if you want to
- In the pull request, we can discuss together about _how_ to solve the issue
- Whether it is your first pull request or your 100th, I'm happy to give you a hand with the Git, GitHub or code details!
- I'll finally ask you how you prefer to be given credit for your contribution, so we can include that in your pull request and merge it üêø
